# SIRItoGTFS
SIRItoGTFS r package

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bogind/SIRItoGTFS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bogind/SIRItoGTFS)


For users unfamiliar with writing code, the only functions you will need are:   
* `readGTFS` - which loads tables from a folder with the prefix of "GTFS"   
* `STG` - which performs a test between the SIRI data you have and the GTFS tables.   
    
see documentation for both for further instructions.
